What is Ansible?
If you are a system administrator or IT engineer you probably involved in doing a lot of repetitive task in your environment whether it be sizing, creating a new house or virtual machines every day, applying configuration on them, patching hundreds of servers, migration or even performing security and compliance audits. All of these very repetitive tasks involve the execution of hundreds of commands on hundreds of different servers.  Smart people develop a script to automate these tasks but it requires coding skills and regular maintenance of this script and a lot of time to put this script together in the first place. That’s where the Ansible comes in the picture.

Ansible is a powerful IT automation tool that you can quickly learn. It’s simple enough for everyone in IT yet powerful enough to automate even the most complex deployment.
